# `xs`
Convenient CLI app for manipulation of [XScout](https://github.com/Team612/XScout) data. Also works with any compatible JSON-format data.

## Installation
* Install `python3`.
* Clone the `xs` repository and move into it:

        git clone https://github.com/WardBenjamin/xs && cd xs

* If using on a Unix-based OS, you can copy `xs.py` to an executable location, for example:

        cp xs.py /usr/local/bin/x

    Make sure to use `chmod +x xs.py` first to mark the script as executable if necessary.

## Commands
Commands are being added as needed, so for now they're few. That will gradually change.
* `xs cons` - consolidate all JSON scouting data files in the working directory into one.
* `xs csv`/`spreadsheet`/`ss` - convert raw JSON file into a CSV spreadsheet.
